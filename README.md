# AI-Search_Strategies_for_Pacman_Maze
This project implements AI search algorithms to solve pathfinding problems in the Pacman game. It includes Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search, aiming to efficiently navigate Pacman through mazes while collecting food and avoiding obstacles, demonstrating practical AI applications in gaming.
